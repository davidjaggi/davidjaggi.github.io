The headings are \u201cDate,Time,Open,High,Low,Close,Vol,OI\u201d which are specially set in order to import the file into BuildAlpha. After inserting the indicator into MC set the bar time correctly and set the input iPrint to true. The file should only take a few seconds to be generated.","title":"Extract data directly from multicharts"}]}
